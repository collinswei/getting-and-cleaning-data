##Data Background
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Data transformation

The raw data sets are processed with "run_analisys.R" script to create a tidy data set with "tidydata.txt".

### Transformation steps:
(1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
(2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
(3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
(4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
(5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## tidydata.txt

The tidy data set a set of variables for each activity and each subject. 10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard deviation features are averaged for each group. The resulting data table has 180 rows and 69 columns. The tidy data setâ€™s first row is the header containing the names for each column.
